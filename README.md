# QuickView

What do you see when you lay your hands on a DataSet the very first time before you even start doing some visualization? First the file size, number of rows and columns. Beyond that you either need to code at least a few lines of code for every scenario (plot/visualization) or use Excel inbuilt tools to get the insights from the dataset. With QuickView, you won't need to write more than one line of code, except _import_ statement ofcourse :)

QuickView gives you a quick glance at the dataset, just pass the pandas dataframe. It gives some useful summary and plots with just one line of code. All the summary that it outputs is made available through member variables. Check the [usage](https://github.com/avannaldas/QuickView/blob/master/Docs/QuickView%20Usage.md) under [Docs](https://github.com/avannaldas/QuickView/blob/master/Docs) for more info about installation and usage.

I hope this package helps as a first line of attack in the data analysis to get you off the ground real quick, though in a very simple and rudimentary way. Ease of use and simplicity will always be the central focus. QuickView has been built using matplotlib. QuickView is made for basic data analyis/visualization and for anything beyond that consider using matplotlib or some other similar advanced data visualization library.

The project has just begun, I'll be extending this slowly as and when time permits. Feedback/suggestions most welcome. If you would like to contribute, feel free drop me a note.
