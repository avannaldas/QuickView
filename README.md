# QuickView

What do you see when you lay your hands on a DataSet the very first time before you even start doing some visualization? First the file size, number of rows and columns. Beyond that you either need to code or fiddle around in Excel to get the insights from the dataset. With QuickView, you won't need to write more than one line of code, except ***import quickview*** ofcourse :)

QuickView gives you a quick glance at the dataset, just pass the pandas dataframe. It gives some useful summary and plots with just one line of code. All the summary that it outputs is made available through member variables. 

The project has just begun, I'll be adding more features and extending this slowly. I hope this package helps as a first line of attack to get you off the ground real quick data analysis, though in a very simple and rudimentary way. Ease of use and simplicity will always be the central focus. QuickView has been built using matplotlib. QuickView is made for basic data analyis/visualization and for anything beyond that consider using matplotlib or some other similar advanced data visualization library.

### Roadmap
1. Min, Max, Mean, Median Plots
2. Correlation and Covariance Plots
3. Outliers Plots
